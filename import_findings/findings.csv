Improper Input Validation and Injection in Apache Log4j2,"Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to an attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.\n\n\n# Affected packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.\n\nThis issue does not impact default configurations of Log4j2 and requires an attacker to have control over the Log4j2 configuration, which reduces the likelihood of being exploited.",todolist-goof/todolist-web-struts/pom.xml,critical,org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core,">= 2.4, < 2.12.4",CVE-2021-44832,Update to version 2.12.4 or newer,https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832
Polymorphic typing issue,"A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind 2.0.0 through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the p6spy (3.8.6) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can find an RMI service endpoint to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload. This issue exists because of com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6DataSource mishandling.",todolist-goof/todolist-web-common/pom.xml,critical,com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind,<= 2.9.10.0,CVE-2019-16943,Update to version 2.9.10.1 or newer,https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16943
